# Machine Learning Models

We will implement a series of popular machine learning models to augment the analysis
of purchases that we modeled with linear regression in Assignment 4. 
We will not follow a textbook but rather online notes about these models 
and we will focus on the implementation rather than the statistical theory behind them. 

We will use the ```tidymodels``` library as a cohesive workflow for implementing 
machine learning models. 

For more information about the ```tidymodels``` library, 
please see [The Tidymodels Webpage](https://www.tidymodels.org/)
