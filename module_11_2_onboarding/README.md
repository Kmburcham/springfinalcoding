### Onboarding at a large organization: A well-oiled machine

Onboarding at a Large Organization
- You start with many others during a formal onboarding process
- Received an email detailing instructions on location, arrival time, and required items
- You are issued a laptop and set it up
- Attend presentations on company culture, HR policies, and organizational structure
- The onboarding process is well-organized, having been done for thousands of employees

Data Science Onboarding
- Assistance is provided for setting up your coding environment
- Expect a checklist or documentation for data access procedures
- Access to a central repository of old reports and data documentation
- It’s normal not to deliver much immediately as co-workers anticipate a learning curve
- Completion of training and access approvals may take weeks

Work Approach and Expectations
- Treat any assignments seriously but prioritize the process over results
- Familiarize yourself with the unique practices of the data science team
- Asking questions is essential for future job performance
- Early months are key for learning processes and team dynamics

### Onboarding at a small company: What onboarding?

Onboarding Experience in a Startup
- Expect some unpreparedness when starting.
- Laptop and access to data may not be ready.
- May struggle to access poorly optimized data; e. g. , SQL queries on small tables can be slow.
- Onboarding sessions may not happen for weeks, depending on new hires.

Lack of Structure
- No established data science standards or guidelines.
- No direction on programming languages or analysis structuring.
- Expected to produce results quickly without comprehensive guidance.

Risks of Working in Chaos
- Potential for making mistakes without immediate feedback.
- Incorrect work may be relied upon for months unnoticed.
- Importance of asking questions to establish understanding.
- Avoid going from crisis to crisis to prevent burnout.
- Emphasize building personal processes for long-term success.

### Understanding and setting expectations

Importance of Meeting with Manager
- Schedule a meeting with your manager in the first weeks to discuss priorities.
- This meeting helps clarify job expectations and goals.

Understanding Job Priorities
- Different data science jobs have different focuses (analyses vs. model building).
- Job expectations can change from the interview process to the start date.
- Early discussions with your manager provide up-to-date information.

Defining Success
- Work with your manager to define what success looks like in your role.
- Success is often about contributing to team and managerial goals.
- Understand the team's problems and performance evaluation methods.

Performance Goals Clarification
- Performance goals are not solely about accuracy or using the latest models.
- Focus on the utility, insights, and maintainability of models rather than just accuracy.

Job Responsibilities and Teamwork
- Different companies have varied expectations regarding teamwork and project management.
- Some prioritize collaboration and quick shifts to assist others, while others focus on individual deliverables.
- Regular meetings with your direct supervisor are key to understanding expectations.

Feedback and Progress Monitoring
- Weekly one-on-ones provide a platform to discuss progress and challenges.
- Get explicit feedback instead of guessing what is expected.
- Short-term focus helps stay aligned before larger performance reviews.


#### Setting yourself up for success

- In larger companies, there is usually a formal performance review process.
- Ask about the performance review process and its schedule.
- Common practice involves reviews every six months, possibly with salary increases and promotions.
- Reviews may follow a 360 process, receiving feedback from managers and peers.
- Determine if you choose your peers for feedback or if your manager does.
- Established data science teams may have a matrix for evaluation criteria based on seniority levels.
- Junior data scientists may need foundational knowledge; mid-level may have one area of expertise; senior may be the expert in a specific area.
- If no matrix exists, work with your manager to identify evaluation areas.
- Plan a review with your manager after your first three months if it’s not standard.
- The review ensures alignment with your manager and updates on progress.
- Defining success doesn’t require excelling in every area initially.
- Most companies won’t formally evaluate employees in the first six months due to on-ramping.
- Defining success is about understanding your role and keeping the big picture in mind.

### Asking questions

The Importance of Asking Questions
- Fear of asking questions or admitting "I don’t know" can hinder career growth.
- Data science is vast; no one knows everything.
- Managers prefer employees who ask questions rather than struggle for days.

Types of Questions to Ask
- Technical questions: Examples include statistical tests used in analyses.
- Business questions: Examples include identifying the responsible team for a product.

Tips for Asking Better Questions
- Understand Question Culture: Observe how questions are typically asked in the company (in-person, Slack, forums, email).
- Be Proactive: Show prior research before asking questions.
- Avoid Simple Questions: Don’t ask easily found answers (e. g. , basic programming differences).
- Respect Experts' Time: Identify experts for specific questions and consider scheduling dedicated meetings instead of frequent interruptions.
- Avoid Criticism veiled as Questions: Seek genuine understanding rather than criticizing current methods or decisions (e. g. , complex systems and historical decisions).
- Pairing with Others: Learn by observing how colleagues find answers or solve problems in real-time.
- Maintain a Question List: Compile a list of non-urgent questions to discuss with a mentor or manager to prevent constant interruptions.

###  Building relationships

Building a Support Network

- Feeling comfortable in a new work environment requires building a support network.
- Engage in nontechnical talk with colleagues.
- Set up meetings with unfamiliar colleagues to learn about them and their work.
- Use questions to start conversations and show you are friendly and polite.

Connecting with Colleagues

- Message those you will be working closely with to arrange a 30-minute meeting.
- If in a large office, ask your manager for a list of important people to know.
- Identify individuals to turn to for specific questions or technical issues.
- Make an effort to introduce yourself to your skip-level boss for better recognition.

Meeting Stakeholders

- Meet all stakeholders you will collaborate with, especially in small teams.
- Hold informal meetings to avoid only being known as an email signature.
- Use video conferencing to connect faces, even if working remotely.

Listening and Learning

- Do a lot of listening during meetings and social events like lunch.
- Meet people in data-adjacent areas to understand their roles.
- Avoid rushing to make commitments or claims about improving their work.
- Get to know colleagues personally by asking about their lives outside of work.

Befriend the Office Manager

- Befriend the office manager, who influences daily comfort at work.
- Show appreciation for their hard work and the little things they manage.

#### Mentorship and Sponsorship 


- Finding a mentor is common career advice but can be hard to act on.
- A mentor provides career advice and helps with decision-making.
- There are no specific classes or books on how to find a mentor.

Finding a Mentor
- Mentorship does not always have to be a long-term commitment.
- Angela Bassa created a list for data science newcomers to connect with mentors at datahelpers. org.
- A mentor can assist with specific problems, like behavioral interviews or project development.

Role of a Sponsor
- A sponsor is more influential than a mentor.
- Sponsors provide opportunities such as project funding or promoting individuals.
- It’s crucial to show sponsors you can excel in the given opportunity.

Building Confidence with Sponsors
- Be responsive and polite in communications to build confidence with a sponsor.
- Share your relevant experiences to demonstrate capability even if you haven’t done the exact task before.

Long-Term Relationships with Mentors and Sponsors
- Keep mentors and sponsors informed about your progress and successes.
- Many mentors and sponsors enjoy seeing how their advice helps you.
- Avoid only reaching out when you need something to prevent appearing using them.

Community Connections
- Finding sponsors and mentors within your company is vital, especially in larger organizations.
- Data scientists often change jobs; building a network outside your company is beneficial.
- Create a positive reputation within the broader data science community for lasting connections.
