### Decoding descriptions

Job Descriptions in Data Science

Types of Job Postings
- Business Intelligence Analyst Position:
- Uses tools like Excel and Tableau, with minimal coding.
- Not suitable for those wanting to enhance coding skills or knowledge in machine learning or data engineering.

Unicorn Role:
- Requires extensive qualifications (e. g. , PhD, 5+ years as a data scientist).
- Involves diverse responsibilities and may indicate company uncertainty about role expectations.

Understanding Job Requirements
- Identify company needs:
- Determine if the role aims to build a new department or enhance an existing team.
- Assess if immediate contributions are expected or if extensive expertise is required.

Analyze Job Descriptions:
- Be cautious of phrases with deeper meanings (e. g. , "Work hard and play hard" suggests long hours and social obligations).
- "Self-starter and independent" indicates limited support.

Application Flexibility
- Job descriptions are wish lists:
- If you meet about 60% of qualifications, consider applying.
- Don't focus too much on "nice to haves. "

- Experience as a Proxy:
- Years of experience serve as a skill indicator; related experience (including grad school projects) can be relevant.

Common Terminology Confusion
- Similar terms can mean the same thing (e. g. , regression vs. supervised learning).
- Research unknown terms; your past experiences may align with different terminology.

Identifying Red Flags
- Watch for warning signs in job postings to detect potential negative work environments.

Degree Requirements
- Many data science roles require degrees in quantitative fields:
- Applicants without specific degrees can still apply if they have relevant coursework.
- Highlight projects and blog posts that demonstrate capabilities.

###  Watching for red flags

Job Search Process

- Finding a job involves both the employer and the applicant being selective.
- It’s important to avoid toxic workplaces or boring jobs.

Warning Signs to Watch For

No Job Description
- A lack of description for the company or role indicates a one-sided hiring process.
- May suggest the company doesn't consider the applicant's perspective.

Extensive, Broad Requirements
- Job descriptions that list multiple roles (like decision science, analytics, machine learning) as primary responsibilities should be approached cautiously.
- Expecting an individual to be an expert in all areas is unrealistic.

Mismatches Between Requirements and Description
- Be cautious if the job requirements don’t align with the job functions (e. g. , deep learning experience required but tasks involve dashboard creation).
- This may indicate the company is more focused on prestige than practical needs.

###  Setting your expectations

Standards for a Potential Job
- Have standards but avoid demanding perfection.
- Don't view the path to becoming a data scientist as a linear step-by-step process.

Reality of Data Science Jobs
- Common perception of data science as a highly desirable job with a great salary and job satisfaction is idealized.
- Working in data science involves facing challenges such as:
- Incomplete or messy data.
- Unforeseen issues arising during projects.
- Constant learning and adaptation is necessary.

Expectations from Companies
- Idealization of companies can be misleading.
- Companies often receive many job applications and set high bars for candidates.
- The appealing work you read about may not reflect the actual role available.

First Job Realities
- You may not land your dream job in your first data science role.
- Consider transitioning within your current field or incorporating data science into your existing role.
- Allow for some flexibility in job preferences while starting out.
- Job switching is common in the tech industry, and early positions can provide valuable experience.
- Learning from various job experiences—even negative ones—is beneficial.

### Attending meetups

Job Boards and Application Effectiveness
- Job boards are common for finding open positions but not very effective.
- Cold online applications usually have low response rates.
- Most employed data scientists find jobs through recruiters and personal connections.

Building Your Network Through Meetups
- Meetups are in-person meetings held on weekday evenings, often featuring speakers or panels.

- Reasons for rejections often lie outside your control.
- Process any feelings of disappointment in a healthy way.
- Having multiple options keeps motivation high and helps in moving forward.

Making Informed Job Decisions

- Multiple options allow for better decision-making.
- Be clear about non-negotiable job requirements to ensure they are met.
- Avoid waiting for an ideal job; prioritize positions that fulfill your key requirements.


## Deciding which jobs to apply for

Job Application Strategy
- You should have a list of at least a dozen jobs you’re interested in.
- Some people apply to many jobs to increase response chances, but this can weaken each application.
- Tailoring applications requires being selective about where to apply.

Understanding Data Science Roles
- Consider what aspects of data science you want to explore.
- Companies that are new to data science may allow for a broader scope of work.
- Established companies often have specialized roles but may offer better data resources.

Researching Companies
- Check if a company has a data science blog to understand the work of their data scientists.
- Include positive mentions of a company's blog in your cover letter.
- If unfamiliar with a company, visit their website to learn about their services and revenue sources.

Identifying Company Values
- Reflect on what's important to you, such as remote work and vacation days.
- Consider if the company offers support for conference attendance.
- Analyze the company culture based on its communication style—playful vs. family-friendly messaging.

Aligning Benefits with Priorities
- Consider if the company's advertised benefits match your personal priorities.
- Note that negotiation extends beyond salary to overall benefits, covered in later chapters.

#### R AND PYTHON

Job Application Considerations:

- Apply for jobs that use your main programming language.
- Knowing one programming language can help you learn another, but it can be challenging with new job demands.
- Be cautious about jobs that list one language as a plus; it might mean less coding work.
- Jobs requiring both languages may indicate that not everyone on the team knows both, potentially complicating collaboration.
- Clarify during interviews how often each language is used in the team to understand programming skill development opportunities.


Summary
- Search for general terms like data on job boards, and focus on the descriptions,
not the titles.
- Don't worry about meeting 100% of the qualifications listed.
- Remember the job-search process is a two-way street. Look out for red flags, and
think about what kind of data science you want to do.

*Someone who can do the job.*

This is the only type of person they're looking for.

Companies aren't looking for the
person who gets the most interview questions right or who has the most degrees or
years of experience. They only want someone who can do the work that needs to be
done and help the team move forward with its goals.


But what does it take to do a job? Well, a few things:

Having the Necessary Skills
- Skills can be technical and nontechnical.
- Technical skills include math, statistics, databases, and programming.
- Nontechnical skills include business acumen, project management, people management, and visual design.

Being Reasonable to Work With
- Avoid being offensive or defensive.
- Be agreeable, compassionate, and positive during interactions.
- Interviewers should see you as someone they want to work with on a team.

Being Able to Get Things Done
- Skills must be applied effectively to solve problems.
- Overcome challenges such as messy data and model selection.
- Avoid perfectionism that prevents completing tasks.

Interview Process Preparation

- Understanding these three factors prepares you for the interview.
- Discussion of the interview process will be framed around these ideas.

### The interview process

Overview of Job Interview Process
- Job interview process varies by company but generally follows a standard pattern.
